BUG:
	on the detail view, there's a bug when ever a user upvotes or downvotes a post, the ulr stays on the browser, making the action loop 
	a way to solve this has not been found yet, but a peace of code that I found might help, 
after importing the correct modles (from django .views.generic import RedirectView)

class PostLikeRedirect(redirectView):
	def get_redirect_url(self, *args, *kwargs):
		slug = self.kwargs.get("slug")
		print("slug")
		obj = get_object_or_404(Post, slug=slug)
		return obj.get_absolute_url()


then add the correct url under blog, follow the video
